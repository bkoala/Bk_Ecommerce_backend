This application uses Sequelize and express.js to implement the backend of a website that interacts with a Mysql database 

## 
The application database is first seeded with basic tables and test data using Sequelize and Schema commands. The api is modified to include all models of tables and routes used in the application

## 
The application is started using "node server"command from git bash. The server is then started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.

## 
The user can open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags and the data for each of these routes is displayed in a JSON format.
When the user tests API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
he is  able to successfully create, update, and delete data in the mysql database
